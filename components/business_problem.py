        "Agoda is a global online travel platform offering hotels, resorts, apartments, and homestays at competitive prices. "
        "Users can easily search, compare, and book rooms. However, choosing among thousands of hotels remains challenging, "

        "- Users spend too much time filtering for suitable hotels.\n"
